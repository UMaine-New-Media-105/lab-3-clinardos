There were 3 different exercises within the 3rd lab. Each exercise stacked on top of the next. 

Exercise 1: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/fKppr6HQj -- For exercise 1, the challenge was to create an abstract shape made up of different elements this could be a rectangle, a triangle, or even a pentagon. Which I decided to make a smiley face. Then the next task was to change a characteristic/property of the shape using if-else statements and based differing conditions. based on three different conditions using if-else statements. I used mouseX with if-else statements to accomplish this. My if-else statements changed the smiley face to 4 different colors

Exercise 2: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/Asytimt4C -- Next, exercise 2. This is when the task was to change our abstract shape and if-else statement we had just made into a function. I called this function creepySmileyFace. I made this exercise into a seperate sketch so it was easier to see the exact changes in code. 

Exercise 3: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/0x19m8RbV -- Lastly, in exercise 3 the goal was to modify the funciton created in exercise to so that it can be be modified. I also added another function that changes the scale. Within each function, I changed one of the if-else statements to a modifiable parameter. For example, in the color changing if-else statement I changed the last else statement to fill (color) and added color into the parenthesses in the function name. I did the same thing with the scale function, instead using the word size rather than color.
